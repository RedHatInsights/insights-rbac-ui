```

**General component work:**
```
Following CURSOR-CONTEXT.md guidelines, help me implement [ComponentName] - it should [describe functionality]
```

**TypeScript fixes:**
```
Using the TypeScript patterns in CURSOR-CONTEXT.md, fix the type issues in [ComponentName]

### **üîç Investigation & Analysis**

**Check dependency versions:**
```
Check package.json for [PatternFly/Storybook/React] version and ensure we use the correct documentation for [ComponentName] work
```

**Understand existing component:**
```
Following the investigation process in CURSOR-CONTEXT.md, analyze how [ComponentName] works and what data it expects
```

Following CURSOR-CONTEXT.md patterns, fix the build/lint errors in [ComponentName] - errors: [paste errors]
```

## **üí° Usage Tips**

### **How to Customize Prompts:**
1. Replace `[ComponentName]` with actual component name
2. Replace `[specific issue area]` with your focus (TypeScript, data structure, etc.)
3. Add specific error messages or requirements as needed

### **When to Use Each Prompt:**
- **Create stories** ‚Üí Use when starting fresh with a component
- **Investigate first** ‚Üí Use when you're unsure about component behavior
- **Fix issues** ‚Üí Use when stories exist but have problems
- **Component development** ‚Üí Use when building/modifying components
- **Quality check** ‚Üí Use before finalizing work

### **Combining Prompts:**
You can chain prompts for complex work:
```
1. Following the investigation process in CURSOR-CONTEXT.md, analyze EditUserGroup
2. Then following the guidelines in CURSOR-CONTEXT.md, create Storybook stories for EditUserGroup
```
