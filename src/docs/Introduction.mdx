# Welcome to RBAC UI Storybook

Welcome to the **Red Hat Console RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) UI** component library! This Storybook showcases all the reusable components, design patterns, and documentation for our access management system.

## 🎯 What is RBAC UI?

The RBAC UI is a sophisticated React application that provides:

- **User Access Management** - Control who has access to what
- **Role & Policy Management** - Define permissions and assign them to users
- **Group Management** - Organize users into manageable groups
- **Service Account Management** - Handle programmatic access
- **Workspace Management** - Organize resources and access by workspace
- **My User Access (MUA)** - Self-service access overview for users

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Our application is built with modern React patterns and integrates with the Red Hat Console platform:

### Key Technologies
- **React** with functional components and hooks
- **Redux** for state management
- **PatternFly 4/5** for design system and components
- **React Router** for navigation
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Jest & Cypress** for testing

### Integration Points
- **Red Hat Console Chrome** - Platform integration
- **RBAC Backend API** - Permission and role management
- **User Management API** - User and group operations
- **Feature Flags (Unleash)** - Feature toggling

## 📚 How to Use This Storybook

### 🎨 Component Stories
Browse through our components organized by category:
- **Presentational Components** - Reusable UI components
- **Smart Components** - Business logic components
- **Shared Components** - Common utilities and wrappers

### 🔧 Interactive Controls
Most stories include interactive controls that let you:
- Toggle props and see real-time changes
- Test different permissions and feature flags
- Experiment with various data states

### 📖 Documentation
Each component includes:
- **Props documentation** - All available properties
- **Usage examples** - Common patterns and implementations
- **Design guidelines** - When and how to use components
- **Accessibility notes** - WCAG compliance information

## 🎭 Context & Permissions Testing

Our Storybook includes a sophisticated context mocking system that allows you to test components with different:

### Permission Contexts
- **Organization Admin** - Full administrative access
- **User Access Administrator** - User management permissions
- **Regular Users** - Standard user permissions

### Environment Contexts
- **Production** - Prod environment behavior
- **Staging** - Stage environment features
- **CI/Beta** - Development features

### Feature Flags
- **ITLess Mode** - Modern authentication flow
- **Workspaces** - Workspace-based access control
- **Custom flags** - Feature-specific toggles

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Developers
1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Start Storybook**: `npm run storybook`
3. **Build Storybook**: `npm run build-storybook`

### For Designers
- Browse components in the **Presentational Components** section
- Use the **Controls** panel to experiment with different states
- Check the **Docs** tab for detailed usage guidelines

### For Product Managers
- Explore user flows in the **Smart Components** section
- Test different permission scenarios using story controls
- Review feature flag combinations and their effects

## 📝 Contributing

### Adding New Stories
When creating new components, always include:
- Comprehensive prop documentation
- Multiple usage examples
- Permission/context variations
- Accessibility considerations

### Documentation Standards
- Use descriptive story names
- Include context about when to use components
- Document any special behaviors or limitations
- Add visual examples for complex interactions

## 🎯 Design Principles

### Consistency
- Follow PatternFly design guidelines
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Maintain design token usage

### Accessibility
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Include proper ARIA labels
- Test with screen readers
- Provide keyboard navigation

### Performance
- Lazy load heavy components
- Optimize bundle sizes
- Use React best practices
- Monitor rendering performance
