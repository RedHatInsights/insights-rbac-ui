# RBAC UI Project - General Development Rules

## Project Context

This is a React-based UI application for Red Hat's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, built with:
- **React** for UI components  
- **PatternFly** for design system and components
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Storybook** for component documentation and testing
- **Redux** for state management

## Development Workflow

### Never Perform Git Operations
- **CRITICAL**: Never run git commands or suggest git workflows unless explicitly requested
- Don't create commits, branches, or any git operations
- Don't run git commands or suggest git workflows  
- Focus only on code changes and file modifications
- Let user handle all version control operations

### File Case Changes (CRITICAL)
- **ALWAYS** handle case changes properly to avoid IDE confusion
- When renaming files with case changes (e.g., `toolbar.js` â†’ `Toolbar.tsx`):
  1. Create the new file with correct case
  2. Delete the old file with wrong case
  3. **MUST** stage both changes: `git add newfile.tsx` and `git rm oldfile.js`
  4. This prevents IDE confusion where Git tracks old file as deleted while new file is untracked
- Case changes without proper Git staging cause IDE save issues and file tracking problems

### Investigation Process
1. Check dependency versions in `package.json` first
2. Understand component's role and data requirements
3. Look for existing patterns in similar components
4. Use PatternFly documentation for component APIs
5. Verify changes with build/lint commands

### Building and Testing
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run lint:js` - JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- `npm run storybook` - Start Storybook development server
- `npm test` - Run test suite

## Architecture

### Key Directories
- `src/smart-components/` - Feature-based component organization
  - `access-management/` - User and group access management
  - `group/` - Group management functionality
  - `role/` - Role management functionality
  - `user/` - User management functionality
  - `workspaces/` - Workspace management functionality
- `src/presentational-components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/helpers/` - Business logic by feature area
- `src/redux/` - State management (actions, reducers)

### File Naming Conventions (REQUIRED)
- Components: `ComponentName.js/tsx` (MUST be capitalized and reflect component name)
- Stories: `ComponentName.stories.tsx` (MUST be capitalized and reflect component name)
- Tests: `ComponentName.test.js` (MUST be capitalized and reflect component name)
- Styles: `ComponentName.scss` (MUST be capitalized and reflect component name)

This project follows Red Hat's frontend development standards and integrates with the Red Hat Cloud Services platform.
